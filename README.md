## Features

Social queue currently supports posting to the following social media platforms:

- TikTok (videos only)
- Instagram (reels only)
- Youtube (shorts only)

Upload once to Social Queue and post to as many platforms as you want.

Features on the roadmap:


- Instagram carousels
- TikTok carousel posts
- Scheduling posts

You can either self host the app yourself or use the hosted version at [socialqueue.ai](https://socialqueue.ai).

The hosted version has a generous free tier of unlimited accounts (yes, you read that right), but every post on a free account will have a smaller watermark of "posted from SocialQueue.ai" added to the caption/title of the posted.

If you wish to remove the caption/title, you can upgrade to a paid plan.

Paid plans are $20/month for unlimited accounts â€” one flat rate for as many accounts as you want.
